What code does:
# The same new edited file in archival folder replaces old one with new edits instead of creating new if only content was changed and if the name of the file stays the same

New feature to add:
# Adding a PDF or other files reader and archiving (besides txt and dcm for reports) 
# Delete permanently one id  with all its extracted metadata (for clean env and if the patient changes health provider) using search function in GUI
